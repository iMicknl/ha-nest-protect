# Nest Protect integration for Home Assistant

Custom component for Home Assistant to interact with Nest Protect devices via an undocumented and unofficial Nest API. Unfortunately, Google SDM doesn't support Nest Protect devices and thus the core [Nest integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nest/) won't work for Nest Protect.

This integration will add the most important sensors of your Nest Protect device (CO, heat and smoke) and the occupancy if your device is wired (to main power). In addition, it will expose several diagnostic and configuration entities. All sensor values will be updated real-time.

## Known limitations

- Only Google Accounts are supported, there is no plan to support legacy Nest accounts
- When Nest Protect (wired) occupancy is triggered, it will stay 'on' for 10 minutes. (API limitation)

## Installation

You can install this integration via [HACS](#hacs) or [manually](#manual).

### HACS

Search for the Nest Protect integration and choose install. Reboot Home Assistant and configure the Nest Protect integration via the integrations page or press the blue button below.

### Manual

Copy the `custom_components/nest_protect` to your custom_components folder. Reboot Home Assistant and configure the Nest Protect integration via the integrations page or press the blue button below.

## Advanced

Feel free to [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-nest-protect/issues/new/choose) if you find an issue or if you have a suggestion. It is always helpful to download the diagnostics information and to include debug logging.

### Enable debug logging

The [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) integration lets you define the level of logging activities in Home Assistant. Turning on debug mode will show more information about unsupported devices in your logbook.

```
logger:
  default: critical
  logs:
    custom_components.nest_protect: debug
```
