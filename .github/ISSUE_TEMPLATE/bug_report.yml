      description: >-
        This integration provides the ability to download diagnostic data
        on the device page (and on the integration dashboard).

        **It would really help if you could download the diagnostics data for the device you are having issues with,
        and drag-and-drop that file into the textbox below.**

        It generally allows pinpointing defects and thus resolving issues faster.
